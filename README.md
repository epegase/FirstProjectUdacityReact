# Udacity React Nanodegree

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the first project of Udacity React Nanodegree, to evaluate React Fundamentals.

## Credits

To complete this project, I use the book ["Road to React"](https://www.roadtoreact.com/) of Robin Wieruch and the [repository of Sarah Maris](https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-myreads) for this project (class component approach).

## `npm start`
